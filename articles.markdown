On this page, I will post articles that provide evidence explaining why and the
degree to which students across the nation need to improve their math skills.

1. **Arellano, A., Bedi, S., & Gallagher, T. (2016). [Michigan Achieves! 2016 Michigan State of Education Report](https://midwest.edtrust.org/michiganachieves/). The Education Trust—Midwest (ETM).**

   This data-supported report produced by the nonpartisan Educational
   Trust-Midwest group describes how achievement levels of all Michigan student
   subgroups are falling behind the achievement levels of students in other
   states, both in early reading and middle school math. This report then
   describes the next steps in a plan to make Michigan a top-10 educational
   state.

2. **Columbia University. [Community College FAQs](https://ccrc.tc.columbia.edu/Community-College-FAQs.html). Community College Research Center.**

   These FAQs summarize findings from research covering a wide range of topics,
   from the demographics of who enrolls and completes community college to why
   students succeed or fail to earn an associate’s degree.  What I found most
   interesting was the research and data describing the degree to which students
   taking 1, 2, or 3 remedial math courses (not for college credit) fail to
   complete a college-level math class:

   *“A CCRC study of 57 community colleges participating in the Achieving the
   Dream initiative found that only 33 percent of students referred to
   developmental math and 46 percent of students referred to developmental
   reading go on to complete the entire developmental sequence”* (Bailey, Jeong,
   & Cho, 2010).

3. **Bahr, P. R. [A Preliminary Examination of Remedial Course-Taking Patterns in Michigan’s “Achieving the Dream” Community Colleges](http://www.mcca.org/uploads/fckeditor/file/2%20-%20Peter%20Bahr%20-%20University%20of%20Michigan.pdf). University of Michigan.**

   The “OMG!” described this PowerPoint presentation is the degree to which
   community college students struggle in remedial math courses. I believe that
   this data underscores our need to improve K–12 and community college
   curriculums.

4. **Superannuation. (2014, January 15). [How Much Does It Cost To Make A Big Video Game?](https://kotaku.com/how-much-does-it-cost-to-make-a-big-video-game-1501413649) Kotaku.com \[Web blog post\]**

   This article takes a historical look at the costs to develop many of the most
   popular video games that have hit the market since Frogger was introduced
   in 1982. I have always been amazed at the amount of money that investors sink
   into the development of recreational video games. Obviously investors reap
   enormous profits. I would love to see our country reap the profits that are
   possible with a better-educated workforce. I feel strongly that my Number DNA
   project would better prepare users to have greater success in algebra,
   trigonometry, and the science classes needed for success in STEAM related
   fields.


5. **Wan, T. (2015, April 24). [Scholastic to Sell (Most) Education Technology Business to Mifflin Harcourt for \$575 Million](https://www.edsurge.com/news/2015-04-24-scholastic-agrees-to-sell-some-education-technology-business-to-houghton-mifflin-harcourt-for-575-million). EdSurge News.**

   This article speaks to the profitably of the Ed Tech market.

   *“Since its launch in 1999, READ 180 has generated over \$1 billion in sales
   for Scholastic.”*

   *“…revenues from the company’s overall edtech business have flattened
   recently, to \$175 million for the first nine months of this fiscal year.”*

   Yet, students are not profiting by being better able to succeed in algebra,
   trigonometry and beyond. To me this disconnect is glaringly obvious. Critics
   point to the fact that the first-generation education Learning Management
   Systems (LMS) fall far short of their promise to innovate the delivery of
   math instruction. I’m attaching another article (\#6) that talks about ways
   to improve that next generation LMS systems.

6. **The N<sup>2</sup>GDLE Vision: The “Next” Next Generation Digital Learning Environment**

   This article outlines criticisms of many of the Learning Management Systems
   currently on the market and also outlines the elements needed in the “Next”
   Next Generation Digital Learning Environments (N<sup>2</sup>GDLE). I derived great
   encouragement for my efforts to develop my project because Number DNA
   includes most of the elements in the N<sup>2</sup>GDLE shown below.
