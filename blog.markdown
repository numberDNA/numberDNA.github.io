Here’s a Math Problem for You…

…how do you teach a student Algebra if they can’t multiply or work with fractions and don’t understand how to calculate with negative numbers?

Good luck with that one.

Thousands of teachers throughout the U.S. are confronted with this task every day of every school year. Schools (both K–12 and colleges) have struggled to solve this problem for decades with little success.

Think of math as a sequence of skills learned A through Z. Learning skill C depends on whether you mastered skills A and B. But if you only learned a portion of skills A and B, then learning skill C will be difficult or, as often occurs, impossible. So what should students do?

Stick with skill A and skill B till you *get* it! And here’s the secret: *Every* individual can *get* skills A and B when given enough **time**!

Newsflash: Schools don’t teach individuals. They teach groups of students, 20 to 40 at a time. Teachers have to follow tight curriculums that must be completed in a specific amount of time. Despite the very real needs of the individual, time and the curriculum march forward, leaving many behind.

What’s the solution? Build your math skills, one brick at a time, with **Number DNA**.

Number DNA is a set of 16 web-based math apps built around the 16 bricks that must be securely mastered in order to take on and succeed in Algebra and beyond. Number DNA is a flexible package that can be practiced anywhere, on a laptop, iPad, or phone.

After taking a one-hour pretest, each individual receives a personalized report, which acts as a game plan. It identifies which key, foundational bricks have already been mastered and which ones need more study. Number DNA is designed to be self-paced and self-directed, with tons of support both online or via downloadable practice sets.

**Businesses** could use Number DNA as training modules to improve the numeracy skills of all workers. Badging completely through all 16 web-based apps could become a basis for evaluation and/or a modest bonus. It might also be a springboard for additional training opportunities.

**Colleges and Community Colleges** could use Number DNA to help the millions of students who test into remedial, not-for-credit math classes circumvent or replace that requirement. Badging could be used to document a student’s mastery of requisite foundational skills.

**Middle Schools and High Schools** could use Number DNA as a self-paced remediation package. The pretest would diagnose each individual student’s strengths and weaknesses and thereby provide an intervention plan tailored to each student.

\*\*Teachers \*\*can use Number DNA, as it has also been designed to be used in conjunction with the following textbook: *Foundations for Algebra*. This text contains detailed discussions, starting with whole number factors and divisibility and continuing through fractions, percents, integers, and solving basic equations using positive numbers, negative numbers, and fractions.
