##The Problem
Millions of people are held back from achieving their dreams because of Math: children in grades 4 through 12, parents who hope to help their children, young adults at community colleges, and adults hoping to qualify for advanced job training are held back due to missing math skills. Educational institutions continue to struggle as they search for effective strategies to help people catch up after they have fallen behind in mathematics.
But it doesn’t have to be this way. 
Please help me fund a project I believe can change the way we teach and learn math. I call it Number DNA.
Number DNA Explained
Number DNA is a self-paced, web-based program of 16 foundational math apps that identifies what math skills a person may be missing and then teaches those skills in a series of mildly “gamified” 5–10 minutes online math workouts that provide instant feedback and support. 
Mastering all of the 16 Number DNA units means being well-prepared to take on (and succeed in) algebra, trigonometry, and beyond. 
Each number tile tells that number’s story:
      -   Whether the number is prime or composite
      -   How many factors each number has
      -   Whether the number is divisible by the common divisors 2, 3, 4, 5, 		  							6, 9 and/or 10?
      -  The unique prime factorization for the number
Thank you so much for helping me fund this project.  For updates on our progress please go to the Number DNA website at numberdna.org.
