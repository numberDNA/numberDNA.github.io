On this page I will post a number of articles that provide data and opinions regarding reasons why and the degree to which students across the nation need to improve their math skills. 

**Michigan Achieves! 2016 Michigan State of Education Report** by Amber Arellano, Suneet Bedi and Terry Gallagher

This data supported report produced by the non-partisan
Educational Trust-Midwest group, describes how achievement levels of all Michigan student subgroups are falling behind
the achievement levels of students in other states in both early reading and middle school math.  This report then describes next steps in a plan to make Michigan a top 10 educational state.

**Community College FAQ's** Produced by the Community College Research Center at Columbia University

The FAQ's summarize findings from research covering a wide range of topics from the demographics of who enrolls and  completes community college to why students succeed or fail to earn an associates degree. What I found most interesting was the research and data describing the degree to which students taking 1, 2 or 3 remedial math (not for college credit) courses fail to complete a college level math class.

**A Preliminary Examination of Remedial Course-Taking Patterns in Michigan’s “Achieving the Dream” Community Colleges** by Peter Riley Bahr 
The OMG!! that this powerpoint presentation describes is the  degree to which community college students struggle in remedial math courses. I believe that this data underscores our need to improve  K-12 and community college curriculums.

**Making Skills Everyone’s Business: A Call to Transform Adult Learning in the United States**
U.S. Department of Education Office of Career, Technical, and Adult Education February 2015

This report speaks to the need for “upskilling” the literacy and numeracy skills for millions of US workers. 
  > “This report presents a vision for making adult skill 
  development—upskilling—more prevalent, efficient, 
  effective, and convenient. This vision rests on an 
  understanding that foundation skills—the combination of 
  literacy, numeracy, and English language as well as 
  employability skills required for participation in modern 
  workplaces and contemporary life—are a shared 
  responsibility of, and value and benefit to the entire 
  community. page 1

Beginning on page 10 and continuing to page 13, this report outlines Strategy 2: **Transform Opportunities for Youth and Adults to Assess, Improve, and Use Foundation Skills.** 

I am confident that once developed **NumberDNA** will provide an easily accessible intervention plan that
will be an ideal way for workers to upgrade their numeracy skills.  To see the full report, go to [alt text](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ovae/pi/AdultEd/making-skills.pdf)
