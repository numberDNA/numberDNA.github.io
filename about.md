I am looking for funding to develop a product called numberDNA.

NumberDNA as conceived, is a set of 16 web based math apps that are the 16 blocks of knowledge that need to be securely mastered in order to take on and succeed in Algebra and beyond. NumberDNA is a flexible package of web based math apps.  You can practice numberDNA anywhere; on your phone, iPad or laptop. 

After taking a one hour pretest you receive your
personalized report that acts as your game plan.  It tells you which foundational skills you have securely in place and which ones you need to work on. NumberDNA is designed to be self paced and self directed with support both online or via downloadable hardcopy practice sets. 

**Who could use numberDNA?**

**Business** could use Number DNA (and Algebra DNA?) as training modules to improve the numeracy skills of all workers.  Badging completely through all 16 web based apps (in each) could become a basis for evaluation and/or a modest bonus.  It might also be a springboard to additional training opportunities.

**Colleges and Community Colleges** could use numberDNA and algebraDNA to help millions of students circumvent or replace the 1 to 3 remedial (not for college credit) math classes that they are currently required to take.  Badging could be used to document a students’ mastery of requisite foundational skills.

**Middle schools and High Schools** could use Number DNA as a self-paced remediation package.  The pre-test would diagnose each individual students’ strengths and weaknesses and thereby provide an intervention plan tailored to each student.

Additionally, Number DNA is designed to be used in conjunction with a textbook 
Foundations For Algebra.  This text contains detailed discussions that start with whole number factors and divisibility then continues through fractions, percent, integers and solving basic equation using positive numbers, negative numbers and fractions. 



This web page will convey information and progress reports concerning the numberDNA project.
