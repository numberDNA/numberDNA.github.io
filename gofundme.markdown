**The Problem** 

Millions of people are held back from achieving their dreams because of Math: children in grades 4 through 12, parents who hope to help their children, young adults at community colleges, and adults hoping to qualify for advanced job training are held back due to missing math skills. Educational institutions continue to struggle as they search for effective strategies to help people catch up after they have fallen behind in mathematics. 

**Did You Know?**  In 2017, only 40 percent of fourth-graders and 33 percent of eighth-graders tested as proficient in math.  (National Assessment of Educational Progress, [https://hechingerreport.org](https://hechingerreport.org/national-test-scores-reveal-a-decade-of-educational-stagnation/ ) 

**But it doesn’t have to be this way**. 

Please help me fund a project I believe can change the way we teach and learn math. I call it Number DNA. 

**Number DNA Explained** 

Number DNA is a self-paced, web-based program of 16 foundational math apps that identifies what math skills a person may be missing and then teaches those skills in a series of mildly “gamified” 5–10 minutes online math workouts that provide instant feedback and support. 

Mastering all of the 16 Number DNA units means being well-prepared to take on (and succeed in) algebra, trigonometry, and beyond.

**About me**

My name is Dan Neaton and I have taught mathematics for 40 years at the middle school, high school, community college, and university levels. To date, my colleagues and I have worked over 500 hours to get to the point where we need to ask for your help. 
What We Need to Succeed 

**My goal is to raise $60,000** to pay for a programmer to code Number DNA to a point where we can make Number DNA available for beta-testing. 

**Freebie** 

For donations over $25, I will send to you a printable high-resolution pdf of the Number DNA poster seen below. You can print it out at any size and it would make a great gift for any teacher at any school.
