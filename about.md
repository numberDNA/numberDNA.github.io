I am looking for funding to develop a product called numberDNA

NumberDNA as conceived, is a set of 16 web based math apps that are the 16 bricks that have to be securely mastered in order to take on and succeed at Algebra and beyond. Number DNA is a flexible package of web based math apps.  You can practice NumberDNA anywhere, on your phone, iPad or laptop. 

After taking a one hour pretest you receive your personalized report that acts as your game plan.  It tells you which foundation bricks that you have securely in place and which ones that you need to work on. NumberDNA is designed to be self paced and self directed with tons of support both online or via downloadable hardcopy practice sets. 


This web page will convey information and progress reports concerning an ambitious web based project to help its users develop strong foundational numeracy skills.  With this strong foundation any one can successfully take on  successive levels of math training. The name of this project is numberDNA.
