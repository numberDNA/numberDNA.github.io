This blog post refers to how **numberDNA**, once developed,
can be used as an intervention to help adults and K12 students rebuild or build their math numeracy skills. I am looking into a variety of ways of funding the conversion of this vision into a web based package of math apps.
 	     
             **Here’s a math problem for you**

……  How do you teach a student Algebra if they can’t multiply, work with fractions and don’t understand how to calculate with negative numbers??  

Good luck with that one.  Thousands of teachers throughout the USA are confronted with this task every day of every school year.  Schools (K-12 and colleges) have struggled to solve this problem for decades with little success.

So, think of math as a sequence of learned skills A through Z.  Learning skill C depends on whether you mastered skills A and B. If you only learned half of skills A and B then learning skill C will be difficult or as often occurs, impossible.

Solution:  Stick with Skills A and B till you get IT!  Another secret, Each individual can ‘Get' skills A and B when given enough TIME! 

Newsflash!!  Schools don’t teach individuals.  They teach groups of students, 20 to 40  at a time.  Teachers have tight curriculums to follow that must be completed in a specific amount of time.  Despite the needs of the individual, time and the curriculum march forward leaving many behind. 

Solution?  Build your math skills one brick at a time with **numberDNA**.  

**numberDNA** is a set of 16 web based math apps that are the 16 big concept blocks that have to be securely mastered in order to take on and succeed at Algebra and beyond. numberDNA is a flexible package of web based math apps. You can practice numberDNA anywhere, on your phone, iPad or laptop. 

After taking a one hour pretest you receive your personalized report that acts as your game plan.  It tells you which foundation bricks that you already have securely in place and which ones that you need to work on. Number DNA is designed to be self paced and self directed with tons of support both online or via downloadable hardcopy practice sets. 

Business could use **numberDNA** (and algebraDNA?)  as training modules to improve the numeracy skills of all workers.  Badging completely through all 16 web based apps  could become a basis for evaluation and a modest bonus.  It might also be a springboard to additional training opportunities.

Community Colleges could use **numberDNA** (and algebraDNA?) to help the millions of students that enroll each year and require 1 to 3 remedial (not for college credit) math classes.  

Middle schools and high schools could use **numberDNA** as a self paced remediation package.  The pre-test would diagnose each individual students’ strengths and weaknesses and thereby provide an intervention plan tailored to each student.

Additionally, **numberDNA** is designed to be used in conjunction with a textbook "Foundations For Algebra".  This text contains detailed discussions that start with whole number factors and divisibility then continues through fractions, percent, integers and solving basic equations using positive numbers, negative numbers and fractions. 

Stay tuned for more.
